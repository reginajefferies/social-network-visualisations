These networks use empirical data to map a representative sample of six different ego-centric networks, derived from fifteen different possible legal categorisations of people seeking asylum at Australian airports. Egos appear as yellow, circular nodes. Alters appear as blue, circular nodes. Indirect ties between egos and alters are represented by pink lines. Direct ties between egos and alters are represented as teal lines.",
