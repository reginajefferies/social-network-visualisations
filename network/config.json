The network uses empirical data to map the relationship between an asylum seeker, who appears as a pink \u0027node\u0027 and a sample of state actors, who appear as blue \u0027nodes\u0027. Indirect ties between the asylum seeker and state actors are represented by thin, brown lines. Direct ties between the asylum seeker and state actors are represented as thick, green lines.",
